> hexregistry is a storage specification for intelhex files

---

## Purpose

Hex files themselves aren't very meaningful, they contain the software in a
binary format with address information. Having just a hex file alone doesn't
tell you anything about it's content, what program it implements and even if
you do it's usually difficult to trace back to a particular version.

The goal of this project is to provide a framework which defines how
metainformation about hex files should be stored to ensure validity and
traceability.
